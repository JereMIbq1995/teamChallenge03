Samson:
My name is Samson Idoko. I am a computer science student here at BYUI. This is my sophomore year and I am excited for this class. I am an international student from Nigeria. I have been in the US for more than 2 years now.
It has been a great pleasure living in America. I have learned a lot and the opportunities here are enormous.
I love it.
